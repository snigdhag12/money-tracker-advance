## Implementation Details ‚öôÔ∏è
### Add Transaction [POST]

Steps:

- Create a form in React to capture transaction details.
- On form submission, call the addTransaction function.

```javascript
app.post('/api/transaction', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL);
        const { name, price, description, datetime, categories } = req.body;

        const categoryDocs = await Promise.all(categories.map(async (cat) => {
            let category = await Category.findOne({ text: cat });
            if (!category) {
                category = await Category.create({ text: cat });
            }
            return category;
        }));

        const categoryIds = categoryDocs.map(category => category._id);
        const user_id = req.user._id;

        const transaction = await Transaction.create({
            name,
            price,
            description,
            datetime,
            categories: categoryIds,
            user_id 
        });

        res.json(transaction);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error); 
    }
});
```

### Display Transactions [GET]
Steps:

- Create a TransactionItem component.
- Map through the transactions array to render each TransactionItem.

```javascript
app.get('/api/transactions', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const user_id = req.user._id;
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL);
        const transactions = await Transaction.find({user_id}).populate('categories');
        res.json(transactions);
    } catch (error) {
        next(error); 
    }
});
```

### Edit Transactions [PUT/PATCH]
Steps:

- Create an edit form that pre-fills existing transaction details.
- On form submission, call the editTransaction function with the updated details.
- Update the state and balance in real-time.

```javascript
app.put('/api/transaction/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const updatedTransactionData = req.body;
  
    try {
      await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL);
      const updatedTransaction = await Transaction.findByIdAndUpdate(id, updatedTransactionData, { new: true });
  
      if (updatedTransaction) {
        res.json({ message: 'Transaction updated successfully', updatedTransaction });
      } else {
        res.status(404).json({ error: 'Transaction not found' });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  });
```
**Note: :id is a route param here, check [link](https://github.com/snigdhag12/ExpressJS) to know more about express basics**

Sumbit post you do the changes.

### Delete Transaction
Steps:

- Add a delete option.
- On button click, call the deleteTransaction function with the transaction id.
- Update the state and balance in real-time.

```javascript
app.delete('/api/transaction/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
    const { id } = req.params;
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL);
        const result = await Transaction.findByIdAndDelete(id);
        if (result) {
            res.json({ message: 'Transaction deleted successfully' });
        } else {
            res.status(404).json({ error: 'Transaction not found' });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        next(error); 
    }
});
```
If you click delete option in above snippet the transaction is deleted from the DB.

### Real-time Balance Calculation
Do balance calculations in a seperate function which can be called anytime transaction update occurs.
```javascript

export function calculateBalance(transactions) {
    return transactions.reduce((acc, transaction) => {
      return acc + transaction.price;
    }, 0);
  }
```

TO DO: Analyse if using useEffect hook is the best implementation fot this, explore alternatives for better performance.

### Categorization 
Introducing React tag componenent to add category to each transaction. [Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tag-input)

### Sorting, Filtering and Pagination
You can either manually implement sorting by creating your own function and using [react-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)
Explore Material UI Datagrid which makes all these functionalities easy to import: https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/

### Authorization and Profiling

Steps:

- Add Login and Signup Endpoints. 
- Use jsonwebtoken to create and verify JWTs.
- Create a middleware to authenticate requests using JWT.
- Protect routes by using the authentication middleware.
- Modify the transaction schema to include user_id and ensure transactions are associated with the correct user.
- Add user to the transaction schema and ensure only authorized user's transaction are displayed.
- Use session store/local store for maintaining user info.

```javascript
const requireAuth = async (req, res, next) => {
    //verify auth
    const { authorization } = req.headers;

    if(!authorization){
        return res.status(401).json({error: 'Auth required'});
    }

    const token = authorization.split(' ')[1];
    try{
        const {_id} = jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET)

        req.user = await User.findOne({_id}).select('_id');
        next();
    } catch(error){
        console.log(error)
        res.status(401).json({error: 'Request is not authorized'})
    }

}

### Responsive Design
Steps:

- Use media queries to adjust the layout based on the viewport size.
- Ensure the application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Test the application on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

- Example css
```css
/* General styles */
.transaction-list {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Media query for tablets and larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .transaction-list {
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  .transaction-item {
    flex: 1 0 48%; /* 2 items per row */
    margin: 1%;
  }
}

/* Media query for desktops and larger screens */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .transaction-item {
    flex: 1 0 31%; /* 3 items per row */
    margin: 1%;
  }
}
```
